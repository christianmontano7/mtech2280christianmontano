1.	The useless machine- I’m a huge fan of this just because of how weird it is. 
You want it to do something and it literally urn itself off and that is my type of humor. 
I think it runs using some sort of motor which I have not learned yet. 

2.	Zimoun- I particularly liked these projects because it was very simple and all the objects were basically doing the same thing, but it came together to be visually stunning.
I also found the noises very soothing.
I imagine this is also run by a motor and I’m not quite sure what is being used to control everything. 

3.	Self Destroying Washing Machine- I liked this one because it was funny and interesting to watch. 
I feel bad for the washing machine, but it at least it doesn’t have to work for humans anymore. 
I feel like they played with the motor in the washing machine and made it go a lot faster. 
They also probably did a great deal of rewiring both of which I’m not sure how to do.
